# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis

##  Introduction  
This Power BI dashboard analyzes emergency room (ER) data to identify trends in patient visits, case types, treatment times, and patient outcomes. The analysis supports hospital management and ER administrators in optimizing emergency care services.

## Objective  
The objective of this dashboard is to uncover patterns in ER visitations, assess treatment efficiency, examine patient satisfaction, and support operational improvements. It aims to assist in decision-making for resource allocation and service enhancements.

## Core Questions  
This analysis answers the following core questions:
1. What are the most frequent types of emergency room cases?
2. What is the average treatment time across departments or severity levels?
3. How do patient satisfaction ratings vary by department or doctor?
4. What proportion of ER visits result in admission vs. discharge?
5. Are certain states or cities experiencing more critical ER cases?  

## Key Insights  
- Treatment times vary significantly by department and severity  
- Case types such as trauma and cardiac-related emergencies dominate ER visits  
- Cities with larger populations tend to show higher ER admission rates  
- Insurance coverage impacts both cost and outcomes  
- Higher satisfaction is correlated with faster treatment and experienced physicians  

##  Recommendations  
- Improve triage efficiency to reduce wait and treatment times  
- Allocate more staff to departments with higher traffic or delays  
- Implement real-time dashboards for tracking satisfaction and resource load  
- Evaluate insurance gaps that may affect patient care or cost management  

##  Conclusion  
This ER dashboard provides critical insights into hospital emergency operations. The data-driven approach aids in enhancing response times, service quality, and overall patient experience. Future scope includes forecasting high-demand periods and using predictive analytics to proactively manage ER capacity.
